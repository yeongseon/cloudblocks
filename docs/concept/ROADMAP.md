# CloudBlocks Platform — Development Roadmap

This document defines the staged development roadmap for the CloudBlocks Platform. Each milestone is a **Milestone** (development stage), independent of software release versions.

CloudBlocks evolves from a **2.5D isometric cloud architecture builder** into a **full architecture-to-code platform** — generating Terraform, Bicep, and Pulumi from visual designs, with Git-native workflow integration.

---

## Milestone 0 — Concept Validation

Goal:
Validate the CloudBlocks block-based abstraction model.

Key Objectives:

- Plate-based architecture modeling
- Block-based resource representation
- Rule-based architecture validation

Deliverables:

- Core Domain Model (TypeScript types)
- Basic Block/Plate System
- Architecture validation engine

Outcome:

Proof that the **block abstraction maps cleanly to cloud architecture and IaC constructs**.

### Exit Criteria
- [x] Domain model types implemented in TypeScript
- [x] Basic block/plate system compiles without errors
- [x] Architecture validation engine returns correct results for 5+ test cases

---

## Milestone 1 — CloudBlocks Builder (MVP) ✅

Goal:
Create a working **2.5D isometric cloud architecture builder**.

Features:

- Network Plate, Subnet Plate (Public / Private)
- Compute, Database, Storage, Gateway blocks
- Click-to-add block placement via palette
- Rule Engine (placement + connection validation)
- DataFlow connection visualization
- Workspace persistence (localStorage)

Deliverables:

- 2.5D Isometric Block Builder (React + SVG/CSS)
- In-browser Rule Engine
- Workspace save/load (localStorage)

### Exit Criteria
- [x] 3-tier architecture (Gateway → App → Database) can be constructed visually
- [x] Placement validation catches 100% of rule violations
- [x] Connection validation catches invalid connections
- [x] Workspace save/load roundtrip preserves all state
- [x] Build passes with zero errors (`tsc -b && vite build`)

---

## Milestone 2 — Visual Polish + UX ✅

Goal:
Improve the builder experience for daily use.

Features:

- Drag and drop block repositioning
- Block resize and snap-to-grid

Features:

- Terraform HCL generator (Azure provider first)
- Provider adapter layer (generic → Azure resource mapping)
- Export to file / clipboard
- Code preview panel in UI
- Architecture → `main.tf` + `variables.tf` + `outputs.tf`

Example Output:

```hcl
resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "main" {
  name                = "vnet-cloudblocks"
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
  location            = var.location
  resource_group_name = var.resource_group_name
}

resource "azurerm_subnet" "public" {
  name                 = "subnet-public"
  resource_group_name  = var.resource_group_name
  virtual_network_name = azurerm_virtual_network.main.name
  address_prefixes     = ["10.0.1.0/24"]
}
```

### Exit Criteria

## Backend API (Thin Orchestration Layer)

- FastAPI backend for auth, generation orchestration, and GitHub integration
- GitHub App OAuth (not raw OAuth tokens)
- Minimal metadata DB (SQLite): user, project index, run status, sessions
- **NOT** a heavy CRUD SaaS — backend mediates, does not store architecture data

## GitHub Integration

- Connect GitHub account via GitHub App
- Select or create target repository
- Commit `architecture.json` + generated Terraform to repo
- Create branches and PRs for architecture changes
- PR-based workflow: architecture change → code generation → review → merge

## GitHub Repo Structure (per project)

> See [STORAGE_ARCHITECTURE.md](../model/STORAGE_ARCHITECTURE.md) for the complete GitHub repo structure per workspace.

### Exit Criteria
- [x] GitHub App OAuth login works
- [x] Architecture + generated code commits to user's GitHub repo
- [x] PR creation from UI works

- QueueBlock (Messaging services)
- EventBlock (Event triggers)
- TimerBlock (Scheduled triggers)

Example:

```
HTTP → Function → Storage
```

## Template Marketplace

- Community-contributed architecture templates

- Architecture → Code Generation Platform
- Git-native DevOps workflow tool
- Multi-cloud infrastructure designer
- Cloud operations dashboard
- Community-driven template and plugin ecosystem

---

## Development Strategy

Key principles:

1. Start with **2.5D isometric builder core** (Milestone 1)
2. Add **code generation** early (Milestone 3) — the core value
3. Integrate **GitHub** as data store (Milestone 5) — not a traditional DB
4. Keep backend **thin** — orchestration, not CRUD
5. **Open-source first** — community drives templates and generators
6. **Local-first UX** — works offline, syncs when connected
7. **Phased UI/Engine Evolution** — systematic transition from Azure-first to multi-provider visual logic
8. **Phased Documentation Updates** — keep canonical docs synchronized with delivered milestone/phase code changes
